/*1
    Object - It can have properties like a lens and it can have methods to things it can do.

    Array in js is a type of object in js
    Any methods that a particular object has access to are listed inside it's ---> __proto__ property

    When we see " new " somewhere -> we know we need to create some kind of object.

    const ages = new Array(10,20,30);  This is array constructor. TO create array
    
    literal syntax like curly braces --> {}

    * Many data types in js are not objects --> strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined all the primitive types don't fall under the object category. But, js wraps the primitive value into a wrapper object and uses properties and methods on the object. null and undefined don't have access to any properties and methods.
